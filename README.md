TITLE: GA DSI07 Project 2: EDA


SUMMARY: This is my second assigned project at General Assembly (Singapore), as part of a 12-week Data Science Immersive course. The project involves tackling EDA-related challenges for two data-sets - one on SAT scores and the other on drug abuse trends in the United States.
